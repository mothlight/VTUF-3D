Single tree test

&control
iohrly = 2			!Flag: If IOHRLY = 0, no hourly output; if IOHRLY = 1, hourly values; if IOHRLY = 2, values for each layer are output to layflx.dat
iotutd = 9     			!Flag: Calculation of transmittances; IOTUTD = 0, transmittances read from tutd.dat (automatically written at the end of each simulation) If IOTUTD > 0, the transmittances are calculated every TUTDÂ’th (1) day
ioresp = 1     			!Flag: Print respiration fluxes; IORESP = 1, the file resp.dat is created. Default: IORESP = 0.
iohist = 0     			!Flag: PAR Histogram printed; Printed if IOHIST = 1. Default: IOHIST = 0.
iowatbal = 1			!Flag: include water balance (if=1)
IPOINTS=1

&dates
startdate = '09/02/12'		!Specify period of simulation
enddate = '15/05/12'
/				

&treescon	
itargets = 1			!Specify the number of the target tree
/

&species
nspecies = 1			!Number of Species being modelled
speciesnames='O.europaea'	!Name of species
phyfiles='phy1.dat'		!Physiology file for species
strfiles='str1.dat'		!Tree structure file for species
/

&diffang					
nolay = 6			!Number of layers in the crown assumed when calculating radiation interception.
pplay = 12			!Number of points per layer
nzen = 5			!NZEN is the number of zenith angles for which diffuse transmittances are calculated. Def.: NZEN = 5 (maximum MAXANG).
naz= 11				!NAZ is the number of azimuth angles for which the calculation is done. Def.: NAZ = 11 (no maximum enforced).
/

&model
modelgs = 4			!Model to calculate stomatal conductance. MODEL GS=6: Tuzet MODELGS=2: Ball-Berry model (response to RH); MODELGS=3: Ball-Berry-Leuning model (response to VPD); MODELGS=4: the Ball-Berry-Opti model (Medlyn et al. 2011); Model=6: Tuzet (Tuzet NAMELIST needed)
modeljm = 0			!How JMAX and VCMAX parameters read in: MODELJM = 0, read from file; MODELJM = 1 calculated from leaf N content. Default: 0.
modelrd = 0			!How Leaf respiration (RDO) parameters read in. MODELRD=0, read from file; MODELRD=1, calculated from leaf N content. Default: 0.
modelss = 0			!Photosynthesis calculations sun/shade (SS) leaves separately (MODELSS = 0 (Def.); Absorbed radiation is averaged over the foliage in the grid point (MODELSS=1): If MODELSS = 2, calculations for each leaf angle class separately
itermax = 100			!ITERMAX controls iterations in the combined photosynthesis-transpiration model. If ITERMAX = 0 (Def.), leaf temperature is assumed = air temperature. If ITERMAX > 0, an iterative method is used to find leaf temperature, photosynthesis, and transpiration. ITERMAX gives the maximum number of iterations (ensuring convergence)
